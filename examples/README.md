# There are the following files contain the ES examples:

## Example 1: LBFO dataset demo
![Implementation of Updated Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Atom Finding using Early stopping](https://github.com/Pragalbhv/atomai/blob/master/examples/notebooks/EarlyStopping_LBFO_pv.ipynb)

## Example 2: HRTEM dataset (Au/CdSe/Combined) demo
![Implementation of Updated DCNN equipped with Early stopping and automatic-binary-thresholding for Nano-particle Segmentation](https://github.com/Pragalbhv/atomai/blob/master/examples/notebooks/EarlyStopping_HRTEM_pv.ipynb)

## Example 3: Instance Segmentation: Additive Manufacturing dataset (Au/CdSe/Combined) demo
![Implementation of Semantic Segmentation from Semantic Segmentation maps for optical micrographs of Additive manufacturing dataset]([https://github.com/Pragalbhv/atomai/blob/master/examples/notebooks/EarlyStopping_HRTEM_pv.ipynb](https://github.com/Pragalbhv/atomai/blob/master/examples/notebooks/Instance_Segmentation.ipynb))

## Example 4: ImSpec demo
![Implementation of Updated Demo for ImSpec on the STEM EELS dataset using Early Stopping and LSTM Decoder](https://github.com/Hitesh1309/atomai/blob/master/examples/notebooks/LSTM_EarlyStopping_ImSpec.ipynb)

## Example 5: Mat2Spec demo
![Implementation of the modified Mat2Spec for ImSpec on the STEM EELS dataset](https://github.com/Hitesh1309/atomai/blob/master/examples/notebooks/Mat2Spec_ImSpec.ipynb)

### The following configurations were used for training
The parameters like training cycles, patience, and the number of augmented images created are modified so as to run in a Google colab notebook without any premium resources. 
The training cycles were set to 5000 and patience to 500, and the number of images produced was ~ 2500.

One only needs to run the Colab notebooks as is. However, if one wants to test it on a personal machine, they can download the necessary datafiles for Example 1 and 2 ![here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EstVJ5E26k3Juii_K82b88gYmBYrE-4J)

The additive manufacturing dataset can be obtained ![here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s2_9Mmha7q6CcM5LRTyE1EbpbEE4Er5k/view?usp=drive_link)
